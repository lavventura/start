##New tab page with powerful searchbar, ~~bookmarks~~, weather, and nice image backgrounds which can replace your browser's adress bar completely.



Search bar is set to focus on page load.

~~In order to use the keyboard controls, you need to unfocus search bar - [TAB].~~

~~Each category is openable by keyboard and click, press escape to close all.~~

Click on city's name to get detailed weather information for your location from Yahoo! Weather.

Currently bookmarks are set to 'display: none' as I don't use them.

##Search bar 

Search bar script from [@WillEccles](https://github.com/WillEccles) allows this start page work as a complete replacement to your browser's adress bar.

I've added search engines and removed stuff I don't use.

Type 'help' to get the list of commands and search engines.

##Examples:
- 'search query' navigates you to duckduckgo's result page for your search query.
- 'some.webpage.com', well, navigates to that webpage.
- 'meta [search query]' searches metacritic.
- 'yt [search query]' searches youtube.
- 'reddit -r startpages' navigates to [/r/startpages](https://reddit.com/r/startpages)

##Contents:
- Heavily modified version of [pschfr/start](https://github.com/pschfr/start)
- Searchbar script is taken from [WillEccles/startpage](https://github.com/WillEccles/startpage)
- Background image randomizes on page load, from [Unsplash Source](https://source.unsplash.com/) which pulls from [this collection](https://unsplash.com/collections/304263/)
- Weather is from [monkeecreate/jquery.simpleWeather](https://github.com/monkeecreate/jquery.simpleWeather)
~~- Keyboard navigation is thanks to [ccampbell/mousetrap](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap)!~~

##You need extensions for most browsers to use this as your new tab page:
- [New Tab Redirect for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna)
- [New Tab Override for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
- [Custom New Tab Page for Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/custom-new-tab-page/)
- Safari - just set it as your homepage in settings.

~~BTW, it's super fast. DOMContentLoaded of ~225ms (~150ms as an extension!!) :D~~

Not so sure about that as it's now poorly hacked together, but hey, who cares since it works?

But yeah, for now the code is a mess.
